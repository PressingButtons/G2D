# G2D Typescript Graphics Library

A custom built Webgl2 based rendering library.

## Getting Started

TBD

## How does this work

Create an G2D environment by executing G2DBuild(HTMLCanvasElement).

## Why do this to yourself

As a coder I default into having a basis in masochism. On a more serious note, the enjoyment of creating my own system in which I know the ins and outs of how it works.
